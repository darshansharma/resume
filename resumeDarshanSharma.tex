\section{INFO}
Full Stack Developer and Associate Cloud Engineer with \textbf{6} years of experience in designing and implementing scalable web applications

\section{EDUCATION}
B.E in Computer Science (Panjab University) - 2018

\section{EXPERIENCE}

\\ \textbf {Software Engineer at MonkAI \hspace{23mm} Dec 2019 - Jun 2024} \\
* Improved React video player load time in the app feed by pre-loading just 25\% of the content, fetching the rest only after 90\% viewership of the initial segment, guided by user data analysis \\
TS: TypeScript, React, Node, AWS-Lambda, S3, MongoDB

* Reduced DB expenses by 10\% by integrating Redis as a caching layer, resulting in a single definitive database call rather than 6-7 heavy mongodb calls. \\
TS: React, Nest, AWS-RDS, GraphQL, TypeScript \\
\\
\textbf{FullStack Developer at Paxcom \hspace{23mm} May 2019 - Nov 2019} \\
* Decreased the load on the node server backend as it was being used for heavy CPU computations using a load balancer and distributed equal load on 2 separate microservices.

* Achieved a 27\% decrease in server expenses by transitioning from a monolithic architecture to deploying numerous microservices, coupled with the integration of automated scaling and efficient traffic management.\\
\\
\\ \textbf{Software Engineer at Block8 \hspace{27mm} May 2018 - May 2019}
* Optimized a Node.js web application's performance by refining database queries, significantly improving runtime efficiency
